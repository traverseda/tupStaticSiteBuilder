    <h1>Build static sites with tup</h1>
    <p>This is a simple static site builder using jinja2 and tup. Because we use tup
to keep track of what files change, it's very fast. It's not meant for your
typical blog-style timeline website, although you could probably hack that in if
you tried.</p>
<p>You can see a testing page <a href="/subFolder/test.html">here</a>.</p>  </main>
